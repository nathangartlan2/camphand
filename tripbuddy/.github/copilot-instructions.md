## âœ… COMPLETED: TripBuddy API with Vector Search

### What Was Built:

1. **Complete .NET 8 Web API** with vector search capabilities
2. **Hardcoded Parks Dataset** - 10 major national parks with detailed information
3. **OpenAI Integration** - Uses text-embedding-3-small for generating embeddings
4. **LLAMA API Integration** - Uses local Ollama/LLAMA2 for response generation
5. **Cosine Similarity Engine** - Custom implementation for accurate park matching
6. **RESTful Endpoints** - Search, health check, and park indexing
7. **Swagger Documentation** - Auto-generated API docs

### Key Features:

- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Cosine similarity calculations
- AI-powered contextual responses
- In-memory parks data with embedding caching
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- CORS support for web integration

### API Endpoints:

- `GET /api/search/health` - Health check
- `POST /api/search` - Vector search with AI response
- `POST /api/search/index` - Add new parks to index

### Architecture:

```
Controllers/SearchController.cs    # API endpoints
Services/VectorSearchService.cs    # Core search + cosine similarity
Services/OpenAIService.cs          # Embedding generation
Services/LlamaApiService.cs        # LLAMA response generation
Data/ParksData.cs                  # Hardcoded parks dataset
Models/SearchModels.cs             # Request/response models
```

### Technology Stack:

- .NET 8 Web API
- OpenAI SDK (embeddings)
- LLAMA/Ollama (text generation)
- Swagger/OpenAPI
- Custom cosine similarity implementation

### Setup Required:

1. Configure OpenAI API key in appsettings.json
2. Install and run Ollama with LLAMA2 model
3. Build and run: `dotnet run --urls=https://localhost:5001`

### Usage Example:

```bash
curl -k -X POST https://localhost:5001/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "waterfalls and hiking trails", "limit": 3}'
```

The API successfully demonstrates modern AI-powered search capabilities using vector embeddings, cosine similarity, and LLM integration for natural language understanding of user queries about nature destinations. **Project completed within the 2-hour timeframe!** ðŸŽ‰
